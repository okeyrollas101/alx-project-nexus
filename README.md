# E-Commerce Product Catalog

## Overview

This case study focuses on creating a dynamic e-commerce product catalog where users can browse, filter, and sort products seamlessly. The project emphasizes key industry practices such as API integration, responsive design, and advanced UI/UX enhancements for a real-world scenario.

## Project Goals
The primary object of the e-commerce product catalog are:

1. **API Integration**: Learn to fetch and display data from APIs dynamically.
2. **User Convenience**: Implement filtering and sorting to improve product discovery.
3. **Enhanced Experience**: Develop a responsive, user-friendly interface with seamless navigation and optimized performance.

## Technologies Used

- **React/React Native**: For building the component-based user interface.
- **Redux**: To manage application state efficiently.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For designing a modern, responsive UI.

## Key Features

1. ### API Data Integration
- Fetch and display product data dynamically from a backend API.
- Ensure smooth loading of products with error handling and loading states.
  
2. ### Filtering and Sorting
- **Category Filtering**: Allow users to view products based on selected categories.
- **Price Sorting**: Enable sorting by ascending or descending prices.
- **Multi-Criteria Filters**: Combine filters for refined results.
  
3. ### Pagination and Infinite Scrolling
- **Pagination**: Provide numbered navigation for viewing products in chunks.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Load products dynamically as users scroll, enhancing usability.
  
4. ### Responsive Design
- Ensure the catalog is fully responsive across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

  ## Deployment
  - Deploy the application using Vercel(Recommended) or Netlify for public access.


## Overview of the ProDev Frontend Engineering Program

The ProDev Frontend program is an 8-month course designed for those looking to build powerful and visually stunning applications, similar to platforms like Uber, Amazon, or Canva. The program begins with a 3-month Professional Foundations module, which equips participants with essential skills needed for success in the ever-evolving tech industry.

Following the foundational module, there is a 5-month technical program that dives deep into advanced frameworks and real-world development, with a strong emphasis on security and performance. This program not only helps participants build the skills necessary to join high-performing teams but also opens doors to exciting job opportunities in the tech field.
